### Getting Started

**Important**: run `./init` after you clone the repo. It will set up the enviroment for you

`yarn start` will automate the build and start the app. This nukes the build folder as well.

`yarn build` will build a new version. `npm start` calls upon this script.

`yarn lint` will lint your files for you.

### Structure

`/src` houses the source files

`/build` houses the compiled files once `yarn build`

> `yarn start` calls upon `yarn build`

### Manual Setup for Sync

In case you want to manually run the sync or are having trouble with the current sync, there is a JavaScript Version runable [here](https://repl.it/@Tjimenez3/Testing-Repl).
